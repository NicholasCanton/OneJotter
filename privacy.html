				<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
				<p style="color: #999;" align="right">Last updated November 30, 2021</p>

				<p>Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at COCOA STUDIO (“Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please email us at <a href="Mailto:cocoastudio@outlook.com">cocoastudio@outlook.com</a>.</p>

				<p>When you use our mobile application, as the case may be (the "App") and more generally, use any of our services (the "Services", which include the App), we appreciate that you are trusting us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this privacy notice that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our Services immediately.</p>

				<p>This privacy notice applies to all information collected through our Services (which, as described above, includes our App), as well as any related services, sales, marketing or events.</p>

				<p>Please read this privacy notice carefully as it will help you understand what we do with the information that we collect.</p>


				<br>
				<h5>What information do we collect?</h5>

				<p>If you use our App, we also collect the following information:
				Geo-Location Information. We may request access or permission to and track location-based information from your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using our App, to provide certain location-based services. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.</p>

				<p>Mobile Device Access. We may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device's camera, microphone, sensors, storage, calendar, and other features. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.</p>

				<p>The information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, for troubleshooting and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>


				<br>
				<h5>Will your information be shared with anyone?</h5>

				<p>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:
				Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information in a specific purpose.</p>

				<p>Legitimate Interests: We may process your data when it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests.</p>

				<p>Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal information to fulfill the terms of our contract.</p>

				<p>Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</p>

				<p>Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</p>

				<p>More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:</p>

				<p>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</p>

				<p>Other Users. When you share personal information or otherwise interact with public areas of the App, such personal information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly made available outside the App in perpetuity. Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our App, and view your profile.</p>


				<br>
				<h5>Is your information transferred internationally?</h5>

				<p>If you are accessing our App from outside, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "Will your information be shared with anyone?" above), in and other countries.</p>

				<p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will however take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.</p>


				<br>
				<h5>How long do we keep your information?</h5>

				<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 6 months.</p>

				<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>


				<br>
				<h5>How do we keep your information safe?</h5>

				<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your own risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.</p>


				<br>
				<h5>Do we collect information from minors?</h5>

				<p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the App, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the App. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. </p>

				<br>
				<h5>Controls for Do-Not-Track features.</h5>

				<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>


				<br>
				<h5>Do we make updates to this notice?</h5>

				<p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>


				<br>
				<h5>How can you contact us about this notice?</h5>

				<p>If you have questions or comments about this notice, you may email us at <a href="Mailto:cocoastudio@outlook.com">cocoastudio@outlook.com</a>.</p>


				<br>
				<h5>How can you review, update, or delete the data we collect from you?</h5>

				<p>Based on the applicable laws of your country, you may have the right to request access to the personal information we collect from you, change that information, or delete it in some circumstances. To request to review, update, or delete your personal information, please submit a request form by clicking here. We will respond to your request within 30 days.</p>
